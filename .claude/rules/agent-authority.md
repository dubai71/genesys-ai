## Cross-Agent Delegation Patterns

### Git Push Flow
```
ANY agent → @devops *push
```

### Schema Design Flow
```
@architect (decides technology) → @data-engineer (implements DDL)
```

### Story Flow
```
@sprint-lead *draft → @product-lead *validate → @developer *develop → @quality-gate *qa-gate → @devops *push
```

### Epic Flow
```
@project-lead *create-epic → @project-lead *execute-epic → @sprint-lead *draft (per story)
```

## Escalation Rules

1. Agent cannot complete task → Escalate to @sinapse-orqx
2. Quality gate fails → Return to @developer with specific feedback
3. Constitutional violation detected → BLOCK, require fix before proceed
4. Agent boundary conflict → @sinapse-orqx mediates
